Key Features
============

Radar Modeling
--------------

**Radar Transceiver Modeling**

* Arbitrary waveform (CW, FMCW, PMCW, Pulse, ...)
* Phase noise
* Phase/amplitude modulation (CDM, FDM, DDM, TDM, ...)
* Fast-time/slow-time modulation

Simulation
----------

* Radar baseband data from point targets
* Radar baseband data from 3D modeled objects/environment
* Interference simulation
* Target's RCS simulation
* LiDAR point cloud from 3D modeled objects/environment

Signal Processing
-----------------

**Range/Doppler Processing**

* Direction of arrival (DoA) estimation
* Multiple techniques for ULA DoA estimation:

  * MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC)
  * Root-MUSIC
  * Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rational Invariance Techniques (ESPRIT)

* Iterative Adaptive Approach (IAA) for amplitude and phase estimation

**Beamforming**

* Capon beamformer
* Bartlett beamformer

**CFAR Processing**

* 1D/2D cell-averaging CFAR (CA-CFAR)
* 1D/2D ordered-statistic CFAR (OS-CFAR)

Characterization
----------------

* Radar detection characteristics based on Swerling's models
